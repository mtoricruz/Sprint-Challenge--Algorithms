#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Constant - O(1): The number of operations remains the same no matter how large n gets


b) Linear - O(n): While looping in range of n can mean nothing could happen if n < 1. However
as the bigger n gets, the number of operations will increase based on how many times j will be < n. 


c) Logarithmic - O(log n): Recursive functions mean that every slight increase in input, the number of operations will increase significantly as it moves farther and farther from base case.
